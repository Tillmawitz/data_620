    "For this assignment we will be building a classifier from the names corpus of the NLTK library to predict gender based on first names. Given the option of using decision trees, naive bayes, or maximum entropy models we chose to use a naive bayes classifier. Feature construction was based on the paper [\"The sound of gender â€“ correlations of name phonology and gender across languages\"](https://www.degruyterbrill.com/document/doi/10.1515/ling-2020-0027/html?lang=en) which provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics of male and female names in Germanic and other languages. As English is a Germanic language and the names in the corpus are in English, we will be designing our features based strictly on the characteristics of the Germanic names. As a result, many of the features we will build will be categorical and likely sparse which will create a high-dimensional feature space well suited to naive bayes models. While the naive assumption of feature independence is not necessarily true given the tendency of certain letters to correlate (\"sh\", \"ph\", \"qu\", etc.), the correlation is likely not significant enough in the corpus to cause problems."

The paper notes that ending vowel sounds and more front vowels indicate female names while final consonants and fewer front vowels indicate male names. To detect these factors, we will consider the first and last three letters of each name as they will most likely generate the first and last syllables or phonemes. In order to encapsulate the full \"sound\" of these parts, we will also look at the first and last letter as well as the first and last two letters. This will generate a large number of features based on the potential values which will be relatively sparsely populated, perfectly suited for our naive bayes model."

This is somewhat surprising, as one may expect the last three letters to provide a better indication of the ending phoneme, however, this does not appear to be the case. Regardless, model performance is extremely good with little room for improvement. Nevertheless, we will attempt to enhance the model by including the additional features which the literature indicates may be helpful."

    "Comparing the performance of both models on the test set, we get a rather interesting result. While the base features model sees a decrease in accuracy, as is expected, the model with additional features actually performs better on the test set than the dev-test set and outperforms the base features model. It is clear then that the additional features improve the generalizability of the model and reign in some of the overfitting caused by the base features. While this result might be counterintuitive based on the model performance on the dev-test data, they are inline with the conclusions of the research paper used as a reference for feature design. It is possible the model could benefit from some feature pruning of the base features to further address overfitting, however, as the model performance with the additional features is already very good and name spelling can have a very high degree of variance we will leave the model as is."
